            Actor is the base class for an Object that can be placed or spawned in a level.
            Actors may contain a collection of ActorComponents, which can be used to control how actors move, how they are rendered, etc.
            The other main function of an Actor is the replication of properties and function calls across the network during play.

            Controllers are non-physical actors that can possess a Pawn to control
            its actions.  PlayerControllers are used by human players to control pawns, while
            AIControllers implement the artificial intelligence for the pawns they control.
            Controllers take control of a pawn using their Possess() method, and relinquish
            control of the pawn by calling UnPossess().
            Controllers receive notifications for many of the events occurring for the Pawn they
            are controlling.  This gives the controller the opportunity to implement the behavior
            in response to this event, intercepting the event and superseding the Pawn's default
            behavior.
            ControlRotation (accessed via GetControlRotation()), determines the viewing/aiming
            direction of the controlled Pawn and is affected by input such as from a mouse or gamepad.

            The GameMode defines the game being played. It governs the game rules, scoring, what actors

            It is only instanced on the server and will never exist on the client.
            A GameMode actor is instantiated when the level is initialized for gameplay in

            The class of this GameMode actor is determined by (in order) either the URL ?game=xxx,

            During time discrepancy resolution, we "pay back" the time discrepancy at this rate for future moves until total error is zero.
            1.0 = 100% resolution rate, meaning the next X ServerMoves from the client are fully paying back the time,
            0.5 = 50% resolution rate, meaning future ServerMoves will spend 50% of tick continuing to move the character and 50% paying back.
            Lowering from 100% could be used to produce less severe/noticeable corrections, although typically we would want to correct
            the client as quickly as possible.

        <member name="P:UnrealEngine.AGameNetworkManager.MovementTimeDiscrepancyDriftAllowance">
            <summary>
            Accepted drift in clocks between client and server as a percent per second allowed.
            0.0 is "no forgiveness" and all logic would run on raw values, no tampering on the server side.
            0.02 would be a 2% per second difference "forgiven" - if the time discrepancy in a given second was less than 2%,
            the error handling/detection code effectively ignores it.
            Increasing this value above 0% lessens the chance of false positives on time discrepancy (burst packet loss, performance
            hitches), but also means anyone tampering with their client time below that percent will not be detected and no resolution
            action will be taken, and anyone above that threshold will still gain the advantage of this % of time boost (if running at
            10% speed-up and this value is 0.05 or 5% allowance, they would only be resolved down to a 5% speed boost).
            Time discrepancy detection code DOES keep track of LifetimeRawTimeDiscrepancy, which is unaffected by this drift allowance,
            so cheating below DriftAllowance percent could be tracked and acted on outside of an individual game. For example, if DriftAllowance
            was 0.05 (meaning we're not going to actively prevent any cheating below 5% boosts to ensure less false positives for normal players),
            we could still post-process analytics of the game showing that Player X regularly runs at 4% speed boost and take action.

            ALevelScriptActor is the base class for classes generated by
            ULevelScriptBlueprints. ALevelScriptActor instances are hidden actors that
            exist within a level, and can execute level-wide logic (operating on specific
            actor instances within the level). The level-script's functionality is defined
            inside the ULevelScriptBlueprint itself (using the blueprint's node-based
            interface).

            <summary>
            A PlayerCameraManager is responsible for managing the camera for a particular
            player. It defines the final view properties used by other systems (e.g. the renderer),
            meaning you can think of it as your virtual eyeball in the world. It can compute the
            final camera properties directly, or it can arbitrate/blend between other objects or
            actors that influence the camera (e.g. blending from one CameraActor to another).
            The PlayerCameraManagers primary external responsibility is to reliably respond to
            various Get*() functions, such as GetCameraViewPoint. Most everything else is
            implementation detail and overrideable by user projects.
            By default, a PlayerCameraManager maintains a "view target", which is the primary actor
            the camera is associated with. It can also apply various "post" effects to the final
            view state, such as camera animations, shakes, post-process effects or special
            effects such as dirt on the lens.

            <summary>
            Refraction is computed based on the camera vector entering a medium whose index of refraction is defined by the Refraction material input.
            The new medium's surface is defined by the material's normal.  With this mode, a flat plane seen from the side will have a constant refraction offset.
            This is a physical model of refraction but causes reading outside the scene color texture so is a poor fit for large refractive surfaces like water.

        </member>
        <member name="F:UnrealEngine.ERefractionMode.RM_PixelNormalOffset">
            <summary>
            The refraction offset into Scene Color is computed based on the difference between the per-pixel normal and the per-vertex normal.
            With this mode, a material whose normal is the default (0, 0, 1) will never cause any refraction.  This mode is only valid with tangent space normals.
            The refraction material input scales the offset, although a value of 1.0 maps to no refraction, and a value of 2 maps to a scale of 1.0 on the offset.
            This is a non-physical model of refraction but is useful on large refractive surfaces like water, since offsets have to stay small to avoid reading outside scene color.

            ActorComponent is the base class for components that define reusable behavior that can be added to different types of Actors.
            ActorComponents that have a transform are known as SceneComponents and those that can be rendered are PrimitiveComponents.

            The following arrays are used to handle property changes during a state. Because we can't

            is an emitter on our Mesh Component with the same template and socket name we have defined.
            Because these can change at any time we need to track previous versions when we are in an
            editor build. Refactor when stateful data is possible, tracking our component instead.

            Without setting this flag a blueprint will be marked dirty when it is duplicated and if saved while in this dirty

            sets a dirty flag on the package. Once saved the package will fail to open because some unnamed objects are present in
            the pacakge.
            This flag can be used to avoid the package being marked as dirty in the first place. Ideally PostDuplicateObject
            would not rename classes that are still in use by the original object.

            Base class of UnrealEd brush builders.
            Tips for writing brush builders:
            - Always validate the user-specified and call BadParameters function
              if anything is wrong, instead of actually building geometry.
              If you build an invalid brush due to bad user parameters, you'll
              cause an extraordinary amount of pain for the poor user.
            - When generating polygons with more than 3 vertices, BE SURE all the
              polygon's vertices are coplanar!  Out-of-plane polygons will cause
              geometry to be corrupted.

            <summary>
            A CameraShake is an asset that defines how to shake the camera in
            a particular way. CameraShakes can be authored as either oscillating shakes,
            animated shakes, or both.
            An oscillating shake will sinusoidally vibrate various camera parameters over time. Each location
            and rotation axis can be oscillated independently with different parameters to create complex and
            random-feeling shakes. These are easier to author and tweak, but can still feel mechanical and are
            limited to vibration-style shakes, such as earthquakes.
            Animated shakes play keyframed camera animations.  These can take more effort to author, but enable
            more natural-feeling results and things like directional shakes.  For instance, you can have an explosion
            to the camera's right push it primarily to the left.

            CanvasRenderTarget2D is 2D render target which exposes a Canvas interface to allow you to draw elements onto
            it directly.  Use FindCanvasRenderTarget2D() to find or create a render target texture by unique name, then
            bind a function to the OnCanvasRenderTargetUpdate delegate which will be called when the render target is
            updated.  If you need to repaint your canvas every single frame, simply call UpdateResource() on it from a Tick
            function.  Also, remember to hold onto your new canvas render target with a reference so that it doesn't get
            garbage collected.

            Updates the the canvas render target texture's resource. This is where the render target will create or
            find a canvas object to use.  It also calls UpdateResourceImmediate() to clear the render target texture
            from the deferred rendering list, to stop the texture from being cleared the next frame. From there it
            will ask the rendering thread to set up the RHI viewport. The canvas is then set up for rendering and
            then the user's update delegate is called.  The canvas is then flushed and the RHI resolves the
            texture to make it available for rendering.

            CharacterMovementComponent handles movement logic for the associated Character owner.
            It supports various movement modes including: walking, falling, swimming, flying, custom.
            Movement is affected primarily by current Velocity and Acceleration. Acceleration is updated each frame
            based on the input vector accumulated thus far (see UPawnMovementComponent::GetPendingInputVector()).
            Networking is fully implemented, with server-client correction and prediction included.

            Friction (drag) coefficient applied when braking (whenever Acceleration = 0, or if character is exceeding max speed); actual value used is this multiplied by BrakingFrictionFactor.
            When braking, this property allows you to control how much friction is applied when moving across the ground, applying an opposing force that scales with current velocity.
            Braking is composed of friction (velocity-dependent drag) and constant deceleration.

            Proportion of the fade region between cascades.
            Pixels within the fade region of two cascades have their shadows blended to avoid hard transitions between quality levels.
            A value of zero eliminates the fade region, creating hard transitions.
            Higher values increase the size of the fade region, creating a more gradual transition between cascades.
            The value is expressed as a percentage proportion (i.e. 0.1 = 10% overlap).
            Ideal values are the smallest possible which still hide the transition.
            An increased fade region size causes an increase in shadow rendering cost.

            This allows dynamic objects to have a shadow even when they are outside of the cascaded shadow map, which is important when DynamicShadowDistanceStationaryLight is small.
            If DynamicShadowDistanceStationaryLight is large (currently > 8000), this will be forced off.
            Disabling this can reduce shadowing cost significantly with many movable objects.

            If true, forces sub-stepping to break up movement into discrete smaller steps to improve accuracy of the trajectory.
            Objects that move in a straight line typically do *not* need to set this, as movement always uses continuous collision detection (sweeps) so collision is not missed.
            Sub-stepping is automatically enabled when under the effects of gravity or when homing towards a target.

The incoming colors are in RGB space, and the output color will be RGB.  The alpha value will also be interpolated.

            Generate an FText that represents the passed number as currency in the current culture.
            BaseVal is specified in the smallest fractional value of the currency and will be converted for formatting according to the selected culture.
            Keep in mind the CurrencyCode is completely independent of the culture it's displayed in (and they do not imply one another).
            For example: FText::AsCurrencyBase(650, TEXT("EUR")); would return an FText of "?6.50" in most English cultures (en_US/en_UK) and "6,50?" in Spanish (es_ES).

            A level blueprint is a specialized type of blueprint. It is used to house
            global, level-wide logic. In a level blueprint, you can operate on specific

            should be familiar with this concept, as it is very similar to Kismet.

            They have less aliasing artifacts than standard shadowmaps, but inherit all the limitations of distance field representations (only uniform scale, no deformation).
            These shadows have a low per-object cost (and don't depend on triangle count) so they are effective for distant shadows from a dynamic sun.

            MovementComponent is an abstract component class that defines functionality for moving a PrimitiveComponent (our UpdatedComponent) each tick.
            Base functionality includes:
               - Restricting movement to a plane or axis.
               - Utility functions for special handling of collision results (SlideAlongSurface(), ComputeSlideVector(), TwoWallAdjust()).
               - Utility functions for moving when there may be initial penetration (SafeMoveUpdatedComponent(), ResolvePenetration()).
               - Automatically registering the component tick and finding a component to move on the owning Actor.
            Normally the root component of the owning actor is moved, however another component may be selected (see SetUpdatedComponent()).
            During swept (non-teleporting) movement only collision of UpdatedComponent is considered, attached components will teleport to the end location ignoring collision.

            If true, after registration we will add a tick dependency to tick before our owner (if we can both tick).

            When specified, optimal bounding geometry for each SubUV frame will be used when rendering the sprites for this emitter instead of full quads.
            This reduction in overdraw can reduce the GPU cost of rendering the emitter by 2x or 3x, depending on how much unused space was in the texture.
            The bounding geometry is generated off of the texture alpha setup in the SubUV Animation asset, so that has to match what the material is using for opacity, or clipping will occur.
            When specified, SubImages_Horizontal and SubImages_Vertical will come from the asset instead of the Required Module.

            This overrides any current attachment that may be present at the time of activation (deferring initial attachment until activation, if AutoAttachParent is null).
            When enabled, detachment occurs regardless of whether AutoAttachParent is assigned, and the relative transform from the time of activation is restored.

            PrimitiveComponents are SceneComponents that contain or generate some sort of geometry, generally to be rendered or used as collision data.
            There are several subclasses for the various types of geometry, but the most common by far are the ShapeComponents (Capsule, Sphere, Box), StaticMeshComponent, and SkeletalMeshComponent.
            ShapeComponents generate geometry that is used for collision detection but are not rendered, while StaticMeshComponents and SkeletalMeshComponents contain pre-built geometry that is rendered, but can also be used for collision detection.

            Normally the root component of the owning actor is moved, however another component may be selected (see SetUpdatedComponent()).
            If the updated component is simulating physics, only the initial launch parameters (when initial velocity is non-zero)
            will affect the projectile, and the physics sim will take over from there.

            The Retainer Box renders children widgets to a render target first before
            later rendering that render target to the screen.  This allows both frequency
            and phase to be controlled so that the UI can actually render less often than the
            frequency of the main game render.  It also has the side benefit of allow materials
            to be applied to the render target after drawing the widgets to apply a simple post process.

            SkeletalMesh is geometry bound to a hierarchical skeleton of bones which can be animated for the purpose of deforming the mesh.
            Skeletal Meshes are built up of two parts; a set of polygons composed to make up the surface of the mesh, and a hierarchical skeleton which can be used to animate the polygons.
            The 3D models, rigging, and animations are created in an external modeling and animation application (3DSMax, Maya, Softimage, etc).

            It's worth trying this option when you feel that the current cloth simulation is unstable.
            The scale of the actor is maintained during the simulation.
            It is possible to add the inertia effects to the simulation, through the inertiaScale parameter of the clothing material.
            So with an inertiaScale of 1.0 there should be no visible difference between local space and global space simulation.
            Known issues: - Currently there's simulation issues when this feature is used in 3.x (DE4076) So if localSpaceSim is enabled there's no inertia effect when the global pose of the clothing actor changes.

            but will retract the children if there is a collision, and spring back when there is no collision.
            Example: Use as a 'camera boom' to keep the follow camera for a player from colliding into the world.

            A StaticMesh is a piece of geometry that consists of a static set of polygons.
            Static Meshes can be translated, rotated, and scaled, but they cannot have their vertices animated in any way. As such, they are more efficient
            to render than other types of geometry such as USkeletalMesh, and they are often the basic building block of levels created in the engine.

            Type of collision enabled.
                 No Collision      : Will not create any representation in the physics engine. Cannot be used for spatial queries (raycasts, sweeps, overlaps) or simulation (rigid body, constraints). Best performance possible (especially for moving objects)
                 Query Only        : Only used for spatial queries (raycasts, sweeps, and overlaps). Cannot be used for simulation (rigid body, constraints). Useful for character movement and things that do not need physical simulation. Performance gains by keeping data out of simulation tree.
                 Physics Only      : Only used only for physics simulation (rigid body, constraints). Cannot be used for spatial queries (raycasts, sweeps, overlaps). Useful for jiggly bits on characters that do not need per bone detection. Performance gains by keeping data out of query tree
                 Collision Enabled : Can be used for both spatial queries (raycasts, sweeps, overlaps) and simulation (rigid body, constraints).

            in order to use this custom channels
            we recommend to define in your local file
            - i.e. #define COLLISION_WEAPON               ECC_GameTraceChannel1
            and make sure you customize these it in INI file by
            in DefaultEngine.ini
            [/Script/Engine.CollisionProfile]
            GameTraceChannel1="Weapon"
            also in the INI file, you can override collision profiles that are defined by simply redefining
            note that Weapon isn't defined in the BaseEngine.ini file, but "Trigger" is defined in Engine
            +Profiles=(Name="Trigger",CollisionEnabled=QueryOnly,ObjectTypeName=WorldDynamic, DefaultResponse=ECR_Overlap, CustomResponses=((Channel=Visibility, Response=ECR_Ignore), (Channel=Weapon, Response=ECR_Ignore)))

            In the case of impact with a corner or edge of a surface, usually the "most opposing" normal (opposed to the query direction) is chosen.

            Rotation curve - right now we use euler because quat also doesn't provide linear interpolation - curve editor can't handle quat interpolation
            If you hit gimbal lock, you should add extra key to fix it. This will cause gimbal lock.
            @TODO: Eventually we'll need FRotationCurve that would contain rotation curve - that will interpolate as slerp or as quaternion
